# Playbook

The Flywheel Planning Playbook walks you through 7 phases of agent-driven software development, from prerequisites through final review.

**Start here:**

1. [Principles](principles.md) -- understand the "why"
2. [Phase 0: Prerequisites](phase-0-prerequisites.md) -- get your environment ready
3. Walk through Phases 1-6 sequentially
4. Keep the [Quick Reference](quick-reference.md) handy
5. Use the [Prompt Pack](prompt-pack.md) for copy-paste templates
