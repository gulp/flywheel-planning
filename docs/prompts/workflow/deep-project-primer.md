# Deep Project Primer

Essential first step to fully understand a project before any work.

## Prompt

```title="Copy and paste into agent session"
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and
understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully
understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project.
```

## When to Use

- At the start of any new coding session
- When working on an unfamiliar project
- After context compaction to restore understanding
- Before any major architectural decisions

## Tips

- Always use this before significant work
- Essential for maintaining project coherence
- Prevents agents from making uninformed changes
