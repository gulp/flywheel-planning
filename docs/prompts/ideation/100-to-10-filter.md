# 100-to-10 Filter

Generate 100 ideas, then ruthlessly filter to the 10 most brilliant

## Prompt

```title="Copy and paste into agent session"
I want you to come up with your top 10 most brilliant ideas for adding extremely
powerful and cool functionality that will make this system far more compelling,
useful, intuitive, versatile, powerful, robust, reliable, etc. Be pragmatic and
don't think of features that will be extremely hard to implement or which aren't
necessarily worth the additional complexity burden they would introduce. But I
don't want you to just think of 10 ideas: I want you to seriously think hard and
come up with one HUNDRED ideas and then only tell me your 10 VERY BEST and most
brilliant, clever, and radically innovative and powerful ideas.
```

## When to Use

- When you need truly exceptional ideas, not just good ones
- For major feature planning sessions
- When brainstorming product direction

## Tips

- More rigorous than the [Idea Wizard](idea-wizard.md) -- use when quality matters most
- The 100-to-10 ratio forces deeper exploration of the solution space
- Great for finding non-obvious innovations
- Follow up by asking the agent to implement the top 3
- Pair with [Premortem Planner](premortem-planner.md) to stress-test the best ideas
