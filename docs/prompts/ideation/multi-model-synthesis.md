# Multi-Model Synthesis

Blend competing LLM outputs into a superior hybrid plan

## Prompt

```title="Copy and paste into agent session"
I asked 3 competing LLMs to do the exact same thing and they came up with pretty
different plans which you can read below. I want you to REALLY carefully analyze
their plans with an open mind and be intellectually honest about what they did
that's better than your plan. Then I want you to come up with the best possible
revisions to your plan (you should simply update your existing document for your
original plan with the revisions) that artfully and skillfully blends the "best
of all worlds" to create a true, ultimate, superior hybrid version of the plan
that best achieves our stated goals and will work the best in real-world practice
to solve the problems we are facing and our overarching goals while ensuring the
extreme success of the enterprise as best as possible; you should provide me with
a complete series of git-diff style changes to your original plan to turn it into
the new, enhanced, much longer and detailed plan that integrates the best of all
the plans with every good idea included (you don't need to mention which ideas
came from which models in the final revised enhanced plan).
```

## When to Use

- When you have outputs from multiple LLMs on the same task
- For important architectural decisions
- When you want the best possible plan regardless of source

## Tips

- Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, or any combination
- Requires intellectual honesty about other models' strengths
- Great for avoiding single-model blind spots
- The git-diff output format keeps changes concrete and integratable
