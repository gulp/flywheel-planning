# Agent Swarm Launcher

Boot an agent into a coordinated multi-agent swarm.

## Prompt

``` title="Copy and paste into agent session"
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and
understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully
understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project.
Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents.
Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any
messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on
the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads
and agent mail messages. Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where
nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done,
but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads
appropriately. When you're not sure what to do next, use the bv tool mentioned
in AGENTS.md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one
that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all
communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active
agents and their names.
```

## When to Use

- When launching each agent in a multi-agent implementation session (Phase 5)
- When spinning up a new agent mid-session to add capacity

## Tips

- Give this to every agent you launch -- it handles onboarding, registration, and task selection
- Agents will self-organize around available beads
- Watch for "communication purgatory" -- agents messaging each other endlessly without shipping code
