# E2E Pipeline Validator

Comprehensive end-to-end testing with zero mocks.

## Prompt

```title="Copy and paste into agent session"
We really need to have totally complete, totally comprehensive, granular, perfect
end to end testing coverage without ANY mocks or fake data, fake api calls, etc.,
that prove that our entire pipeline from start to finish works perfectly in a
provable, ultra rigorous way. That means the raw data coming in from the various
API services for EVERYTHING (not just one or two fields) for a bunch of test
cases. Basically, the WHOLE thing, from "soup to nuts".
```

## When to Use

- Before production releases
- When building critical data pipelines
- To prove system correctness rigorously

## Tips

- No mocks means real confidence in the system
- Cover the entire pipeline, not just individual units
- Essential for data-critical applications
- Follow up with [Deployment Verifier](deployment-verifier.md) to test in production
