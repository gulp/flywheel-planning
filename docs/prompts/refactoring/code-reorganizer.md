# Code Reorganizer

Propose and execute a logical file/folder restructure.

## Prompt

``` title="Copy and paste into agent session"
We really have WAY too many code files scattered inside src/x with no rhyme or
reason to the structure and location of code files; I feel like we could make
things a lot more organized, logical, intuitive, etc. by reorganizing these into
a nice, sensible folder structure, although I don't want something that has too
many levels of nesting; basically, we should at least start out with making
"no brainer" type changes to the folder structure, like putting all the "x"
functionality-related code files into an "x" folder (and perhaps that inside of
a data_sources folder which might also contain a "y" folder, etc.).

Before making any of these changes, I really need you to take the time to explore
and read ALL of the many, many files in that folder and understand what they do,
how they fit together, which code files import which others, how they interact in
functional ways, etc., and then propose a reorganization plan in a new document
called PROPOSED_CODE_FILE_REORGANIZATION_PLAN.md so I can review it before doing
anything; this plan should include not just your detailed reorganization plan but
the super-detailed rationale and justification for your proposed file/folder
structure and why you think it's optimal for aiding any developer or coding agent
working on this project to immediately and intuitively understand the project
structure and where to look for things, etc.

I'm also open to merging/consolidating/splitting individual code files; if we
have multiple small related code files that you think should be combined into a
single code file, explain why. If you think any particular code files are WAY too
big and really should be refactored into several smaller code files, then explain
that too and your proposed strategy for how to restructure them.

Always keep in mind, and track in this plan document, changes you will need to
make to any calling code to properly reflect the new folder structure and file
structure so that we don't break anything. I don't want to discover after you do
all this that nothing works anymore and we have to do a massive slog to get
anything running again properly.

## When to Use

- When your codebase has grown organically and become messy
- When onboarding new developers is difficult due to confusing structure
- When you can't find files intuitively

## Tips

- Replace `src/x` and `x`/`y` with your actual folder/feature names
- Make sure no other agents are running when implementing the reorganization
- Always review the plan document before letting the agent execute
- The agent tracks import changes to avoid breaking the codebase
