## Prompt

``` title="Copy and paste into agent session"
I want you to do a spectacular job building absolutely world-class UI/UX
components, with an intense focus on making the most visually appealing,
user-friendly, intuitive, slick, polished, "Stripe level" of quality UI/UX
possible for this that leverages the good libraries that are already part of
the project.
```

## When to Use

- When building new UI components
- When polishing existing interfaces
- When you want premium, professional-quality frontend

## Tips

- Works great with Next.js, React, and Tailwind projects
- Reference Stripe's design system for inspiration
- Combine with existing component libraries like shadcn/ui
- Pair with [Deployment Verifier](../testing/deployment-verifier.md) to screenshot-test the result
