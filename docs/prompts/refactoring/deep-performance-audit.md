# Deep Performance Audit

Profile-driven performance optimization with provable correctness.

## Prompt

``` title="Copy and paste into agent session"
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and
understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully
understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project.
Then, once you've done an extremely thorough and meticulous job at all that and
deeply understood the entire existing system and what it does, its purpose, and
how it is implemented and how all the pieces connect with each other, I need you
to hyper-intensively investigate and study and ruminate on these questions as they
pertain to this project: are there any other gross inefficiencies in the core
system? places in the codebase where 1) changes would actually move the needle
in terms of overall latency/responsiveness and throughput; 2) such that our
changes would be provably isomorphic in terms of functionality so that we would
know for sure that it wouldn't change the resulting outputs given the same
inputs; 3) where you have a clear vision to an obviously better approach in
terms of algorithms or data structures.

Consider these optimization patterns:

- N+1 query/fetch pattern elimination
- zero-copy / buffer reuse / scatter-gather I/O
- serialization format costs (parse/encode overhead)
- bounded queues + backpressure
- sharding / striped locks to reduce contention
- memoization with cache invalidation strategies
- dynamic programming techniques
- lazy evaluation / deferred computation
- streaming/chunked processing for memory-bounded work
- pre-computation and lookup tables
- index-based lookup vs linear scan recognition
- binary search (on data and on answer space)
- two-pointer and sliding window techniques
- prefix sums / cumulative aggregates

METHODOLOGY REQUIREMENTS:
A) Baseline first: Run the test suite and a representative workload; record
   p50/p95/p99 latency, throughput, and peak memory with exact commands.
B) Profile before proposing: Capture CPU + allocation + I/O profiles; identify
   the top 3-5 hotspots by % time before suggesting changes.
C) Equivalence oracle: Define explicit golden outputs + invariants.
D) Isomorphism proof per change: Every proposed diff must include a short proof
   sketch explaining why outputs cannot change.
E) Opportunity matrix: Rank candidates by (Impact x Confidence) / Effort before
   implementing.
F) Minimal diffs: One performance lever per change. No unrelated refactors.
G) Regression guardrails: Add benchmark thresholds or monitoring hooks.
```

## When to Use

- When performance matters and you need rigorous, provable optimizations
- After the system is functionally complete
- When latency or throughput is not meeting targets

## Tips

- The methodology requirements prevent "optimization theater" -- changes must be profiled and proven correct
- One lever per diff keeps changes reviewable and revertable
- Run baseline measurements first so you can prove improvement
